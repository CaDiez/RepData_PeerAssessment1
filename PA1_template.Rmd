# SECTION 1: Calculating and plotting the mean of the total number of steps per day


## a) Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r load}
dataActivity <- read.csv(file="activity.csv")
dataActivity <- as.Date(dataActivity$date)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r steps_day}
library("dplyr")
dayStepCount <- dataActivity %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(day.count = sum(steps))

ggplot(dayStepCount) + geom_histogram(aes(x = day.count), binwidth = 1000) + 
        theme_bw() + ggtitle('Total number of steps per day') + xlab('Number of steps per day')
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
